# Stage 1 - Information Gathering/Reconnaissance  

Reconnaissance is the act of gathering information about your target to better plan out your attack.

And this type of penetration testing is the only one that you can perform on any website or target that you want, since gathering information about something is not illegal.

there are two ways that we can go about doing Information Gathering; actively, by directly interacting with our target, or it can be done passively, without interacting with the target. 

A simple example of this would be, let's say you want to gather information for Facebook and you would do it actively by visiting Facebook page and getting all the information that you can from the Facebook page itself.
While passively, it would be if you went on some other website that talks about Facebook and you get information about Facebook from that other website.

This would mean you never interacted with Facebook, therefore you performed a passive Information Gathering.

# Stage 2 - Scanning 
Here is where you can start getting in trouble, if you do it without permission.

Scanning is a deeper form of Information Gathering using technical tools to find openings in the target and in the systems that you're attacking.

These openings can be gateways, open ports, operating systems that target runs, and so on and so on.


In this step, we also perform vulnerability scanning, which is just searching for vulnerable software in the target system or network that could possibly be exploited.

# Stage 3 - Gaining Access/ Exploitation 

After Information Gathering and Scanning comes third step,
which is Gaining Access or so called Exploitation.
And, this is the step where we actually hack the target. 

We use information that we gathered in phase one and phase two, take control of any number of target devices. 

Gaining access of target devices allows us to steal data from their system or to use those devices to attack other devices on the same network.
Usually after this step you can consider penetration tests to be successful, since you manage to gain access to a target system. 

However, this is not the last step of a penetration test.

# Stage 4 - Maintaining Access 
After Exploitation comes Maintaining Access.

This step with the fifth step is sometimes optional.

You might not need to always perform last steps since client might only care whether their system is penetrable, therefore you prove them it is, after the third step, if there was a vulnerability of course. However, maintaining access is also important step and it is commonly done by installing back doors and planting root kits.

But a back door and root kits are are simply programs that will allow us to gain access to that target whenever we want without the need to exploit it again.

We just connect to the back door that we planted in the target system and there it is. We are again on their machine. And last step of penetration test is Covering Tracks.

# Stage 5 - Covering Tracks

Covering Tracks is simply removing all evidence that an attack ever took place.
This can involve deleting or hiding files, editing logs, or basically reverting any changes that you did to the system while the attack took place.
